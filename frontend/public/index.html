            <p><strong>Cluster 0 :</strong> This group of customers has the <b>lowest Purchases and Payments.</b> Although they have <b>sufficient funds</b>, they tend to save rather than spend. These customers represent a segment that could be targeted with incentives to encourage higher spending.</p>
            <p><strong>Cluster 1 :</strong> These customers have the <b>lowest Balance, Purchases, and Payments.</b> With limited financial resources, they are cautious with their spending. This segment may benefit from budget-friendly products or financial assistance options to boost their purchasing potential.</p>
            <p><strong>Cluster 2 :</strong> This cluster includes customers with the <b>highest Purchases and Payments.</b> They have a <b>good credit limit</b> and are active spenders, utilizing their financial capacity efficiently. These customers are the most profitable segment, and retaining their loyalty should be a priority through personalized offers and rewards.</p>
